The TestsAnalyzConfApp program is a console technology software. 
TestsAnalyzСonfApp is designed to reproduce 
a recording (from a text CSV file) of a changing target 
situation (aircraft route) on the territory of an aerodrome.
The main task of TestsAnalyzСonfApp is to develop a recognition 
scenario - whether the plane is on the runway or not.
TestsAnalyzConfApp helps to implement some of the functions 
of the A-SMGCS (Advanced Surface Movement Guidance and Control System).  
To a large extent, the program is intended for educational purposes. 
TestsAnalyzСonfApp is implemented in the C ++ programming language 
in the development environment - Microsoft Visual Studio 2005. 
The program functions in Windows 7/8/10 (x86-64).
